# Employee CMS

## Description
This project sets out to create a CMS for tracking the roles, salaries and departments of individual employees using a sql database. With the help of the inquirer npm(not yet implemented), information about employees can be gathered and recorded. This application also makes use of console.tables for displaying the sql information cleanly, express.js for server interactions, dotenv for mysql password safety, and mysql2 for mysql interfacing.

This project is currently a work in progress and will be updated in the future.
